## Comparisons 

In Python, comparisons will always return a Boolean, i.e. either `True` or `False.` We can use the following syntax to compare values:

* `<` and `>`: greater than, less than
* `<=` and `>=`: greater than or equal to, less than or equal to

For example:

```{r, engine="python"}
print(5.3 < 17)
print(4. >= (8/2))
```

* `==` checks if two values are equal. `!=` checks if two values are different.

```{r, engine="python"}
print(2 == (10 - 8))
```

Note that a single equals sign `=` is used to assign values. However, a double equals sign `==` is used to compare values.

* `var1 = 3` sets the variable `var1` to `3`
* `var1 == 3` checks whether the value of `var1` is `3`
