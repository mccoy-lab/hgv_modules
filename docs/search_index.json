Python comes with a substantial set of pre-written functions. Text on how a function is formulated - name, parentheses, optionally arguments Is it worth talking about named arguments or positional arguments. Be introspective about this For example, the print() function displays FINISH ME OTHER Built-In FUNCTIONS’ 4.5.2 Methods Every data type that we use in Python (strings, integers, etc.) is associated with a set of functions unique to the data type. These functions are called methods. The syntax for using a method is: &lt;objectName&gt;.&lt;methodName&gt;() 4.5.2.1 Example The string method .upper() is used to convert a string into uppercase letters. We can use it either directly on the string itself: &quot;peppa&quot;.upper() ## &#39;PEPPA&#39; or by operating on a variable: pig = &quot;peppa&quot; pig.upper() ## &#39;PEPPA&#39; 4.5.2.2 Modifying objects Using a method may or not modify the object you run it on. For example, the .upper() method shows you the uppercase version of a string but does not modify the actual object that you are operating on. Observe the following code block: pig = &quot;peppa&quot; pig.upper() print(pig) ## peppa pig has not been updated. To actually save the result of .upper(), we have to assign it to a variable: pig_caps = pig.upper() print(pig_caps) ## PEPPA Some methods do modify underlying variables. For example, the list .append() method (which we will learn about later) does change the list if operates on: myList = [] print(myList) ## [] myList.append(&#39;apple&#39;) print(myList) ## [&#39;apple&#39;] myList is altered by myList.append('apple'). There’s no need to type something like myList = myList.append('apple') - this would in fact be an error. Whether methods modify the objects they operate on is something you’ll have to keep track of on a case-by-case basis as you learn new methods.

The delimiter is provided as an argument: print(&quot;Newt eye, frog toe&quot;.split(&#39;,&#39;)) ## [&#39;Newt eye&#39;, &#39; frog toe&#39;] If no argument is provided, then the string is split on whitespace (that is, it is split whenever a space or tab is encountered). print(&quot;Eye of newt and toe of frog&quot;.split()) ## [&#39;Eye&#39;, &#39;of&#39;, &#39;newt&#39;, &#39;and&#39;, &#39;toe&#39;, &#39;of&#39;, &#39;frog&#39;] 4.7.3 .join() The .join() method is the inverse of .split(): converts a list into a string, with list elements separated by a delimiter. The general syntax is: &quot;&lt;delimiter&gt;&quot;.join(&lt;list&gt;) For example: &quot; &quot;.join([&quot;I&quot;, &quot;found&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;fox&quot;, &quot;caught&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, &quot;dogs&quot;]) ## &#39;I found a fox caught by dogs&#39; If we do not provide a delimiter, then the strings are directly concatenated: &quot;&quot;.join([&quot;I&quot;, &quot;found&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;fox&quot;, &quot;caught&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, &quot;dogs&quot;]) ## &#39;Ifoundafoxcaughtbydogs&#39; 4.7.4 .rstrip(), .lstrip(), .strip() These three methods remove unwanted characters on the right, left, or both sides of a string. You can provide the characters you want to remove as an argument: &quot;ricercar........,,,,,,&quot;.rstrip(&quot;,.&quot;) ## &#39;ricercar&#39; Without an argument, the methods remove spaces: &quot; ricercar &quot;.lstrip() ## &#39;ricercar &#39; Note that in the above example we strip the spaces to the left of the main text, but we do not remove the spaces from the middle or right end of the text. "],["lists.html", "4.8 Lists", " 4.8 Lists Lists allow us to store multiple objects together. A list is a sequential group of variables, denoted in Python by square brackets [], with individual entries separated by commas. A few of the neat properties of lists are: Ordered: The list [1, 5, 3, 7] will always store those numbers in the same order. Mixed data types: [\"mercury\", 13, 5.3, False] is a valid list which contains every data type we’ve seen so far. Can contain other lists: [[2, 3], \"sulfur\", 12, 18] Can contain repeat values: [\"tomato\", \"tomato\", \"tomato\", \"sulfur\"] 4.8.1 Indexing What if we want to extract a specific value from a list? We can use indexing. To index in Python, we use the following syntax: variable_name[index] where index is the number of the item we wish to extract. alchemists = [&quot;Zosimos&quot;, &quot;Oresme&quot;, &quot;Flamel&quot;, &quot;pseudo-Aristotle&quot;] print(alchemists[1]) ## Oresme Notice that when we printed the item at position 1, we printed out the second entry in alchemists. This is because in Python, indexing begins at 0. To print out the first entry, we would use alchemists[0]. A couple interesting things we can do with indexing: To print multiple consecutive items, we can provide two numbers separated by a colon :. print(alchemists[0:2]) ## [&#39;Zosimos&#39;, &#39;Oresme&#39;] Note that the first number is inclusive and the second number is exclusive: we include the item at position 0 ('Zosimos'), but not the item at position 2 ('Flamel'). We can index in reverse. To index from the end of a list, we use negative numbers. print(alchemists[-1]) ## pseudo-Aristotle Nested lists How would we extract the number 3 from the list below? my_list = [1, 2, [3, 4], 5] First, we extract the [3, 4] list. This is the third item of the outer list, so it is at position 2 (remember, indexing in Python starts at 0). So we can access the interior list with my_list[2]: print(my_list[2]) ## [3, 4] Within the interior list, 3 is the first item, so it is at position 0. It can be accessed with the syntax my_list[2][0]: print(my_list[2][0]) ## 3 4.8.1.1 Indexing Strings We can also apply indexing to extract substrings from within a string. This is done identically to how we index a list: creature = &#39;stingray&#39; print(creature[0:5]) ## sting 4.8.2 Adding to lists Finally, we can add entries to the end of a list. We do this with the append() method, which is used with the following syntax: list_name.append(item) For example: florilegium = [&#39;marigold&#39;, &#39;thistle&#39;, &#39;wormwood&#39;] florilegium.append(&#39;tansy&#39;) print(florilegium) ## [&#39;marigold&#39;, &#39;thistle&#39;, &#39;wormwood&#39;, &#39;tansy&#39;] "],["for-loops.html", "4.9 For Loops", " 4.9 For Loops In Python, we will often want to perform an action more than once. For example, if we have a list, we might want to do the same operatation on every item within the list. One way to do this is to use a for loop, which is structured like this: for &lt;temporary_variable&gt; in &lt;thing to loop through&gt;: {do something} For example: stations = [&quot;Oddity&quot;, &quot;Londres&quot;, &quot;Cherry&quot;, &quot;Swedish&quot;] for i in stations: print(i) ## Oddity ## Londres ## Cherry ## Swedish 4.9.1 For loop walkthrough Here is how the loop works: for i in stations: In this line, we: Define the temporary variable i. The name of this variable is arbitrary. We say that we are looping through stations. In the first iteration of the for loop, i takes on the value of the first item in stations (\"Oddity\"). Now we perform all of the indented code, which here is just a print() statement. In the second iteration of the for loop, we set the value of i to the second entry in stations (\"Londres\"). We execute all of the indented code, printing out \"Londres\". We continue on doing this until there is nothing left in stations. In this example, there was a single line in the body of the loop, but a for loop can be arbitrarily long. Here is a longer example: my_list = [1, 4, 6, 9, 10, 2] for i in my_list: i = i + 3 i = i ** 2 print(i) ## 16 ## 49 ## 81 ## 144 ## 169 ## 25 4.9.2 Repeating an action n times We can also use a for loop to perform an action a set number of times, even when we don’t have a list to loop through. To do so, we can use the range() function. We’ll use this function a ton throughout the course. range(&lt;n&gt;), where n is a single integer, generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n (not including n itself). So to run a function 3 times, we would provide the for loop with range(3) (which generates the list [0, 1, 2]). for i in range(3): print(i) ## 0 ## 1 ## 2 So far, the body of our for loop has always referenced the temporary variable i. We can also use a for loop to run a block of code repeatedly without actually manipulating i: for i in range(3): print(&quot;All work and no play&quot;) ## All work and no play ## All work and no play ## All work and no play "],["reading-in-data.html", "4.10 Reading in Data", " 4.10 Reading in Data When working in Python, we often want to import data from an external file or, conversely, write our data to a file. To interact with external data objects, we use the open() function. This function takes two arguments: the name of the file we want to work with, and the mode that we want to interact with this file. The common modes we use are: r - Read. This allows us to import data from an external file into python. w - Write. This allows us to write our data to a file. If a file with this name already exists, operating in w mode will overwrite existing file contents. a - Append. This allows us to write our data to a file. If a file with this name already exists, operating in a mode will add to existing file contents. To open a file with the name insects.txt, for reading in file contents, we would therefore use the syntax: f = open(&#39;insects.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) 4.10.1 Parsing a file If we try to print() f, we get the following output: &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='insects.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'&gt; This is because we have opened the file and saved it as a variable, but we haven’t actually read through and manipulated the data which it contains. We have two main ways of doing this in base Python: 4.10.1.1 1. Parsing with a for loop One way to look through a file’s contents line by line is to use a for loop. We can loop through a file with the syntax: for line in f: print(line) ## Hercules beetle ## ## Swallowtail ## ## Ornate mantis ## ## Weevil ## ## Pine chaffer As it turns out, at the end of each line, there is a special end of line character, \\n. To just read in the data without the return character, we can use .strip(): for line in f: print(line.strip(&#39;\\n&#39;)) 4.10.1.2 2. Parsing with readlines() readlines() is a method that allows us to read through the entire file all at once, returning file contents as a list: ## [&#39;Hercules beetle\\n&#39;, &#39;Swallowtail\\n&#39;, &#39;Ornate mantis\\n&#39;, &#39;Weevil\\n&#39;, &#39;Pine chaffer\\n&#39;] This is more concise than a for loop, but all lines are read in without the manipulations that we can perform line-by-line in our loop. 4.10.1.3 Closing files We can close a file with the .close() method. To close insects.txt (previously saved as the variable f), we would run: Once the file is closed, we cannot read it or write to it without opening it again. "],["modules.html", "4.11 Modules", " 4.11 Modules Often, we need to make use of functions beyond the basic ones in Python. To do this, we can import a module, or a collection of pre-written functions. A module is imported with the following syntax: import &lt;module name&gt; For example, to import the popular plotting module Matplotlib, we write: import matplotlib.pyplot 4.11.1 Module functions To use a function from Matplotlib, we need to reference both the package name and the function name, with the general syntax: moduleName.functionName() To use Matplotlib’s show() function, we would write: matplotlib.pyplot.show() 4.11.2 Abbreviating module names What if you don’t want to write out matplotlib.pyplot every time you run a Matplotlib function? To simplify this, we can give our modules a shorthand name. For example: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Now, instead of writing out matplotlib.pyplot, we can just write plt. The previous matplotlib.pyplot.show() command is shortened to: plt.show() "],["numpy-1.html", "4.12 Numpy", " 4.12 Numpy Numpy is a Python library used for manipulating arrays and performing mathematical operations on matrices. For concision, we will import the numpy module with the name np, as such: import numpy as np 4.12.1 Reading in data The function np.loadtxt() is used to read in text data. The most basic way to run np.loadtxt() is: np.loadtxt(&lt;fname&gt;) Consider a hypothetical comma-delimited file numbers.csv. The most basic way of reading it in is to run np.loadtxt('numbers.csv'). However, when we read in data, we typically want to store it in memory for further manipulation, so we usually use np.loadtxt() in conjunction with variable assignment: myNumbers = np.loadtxt(&#39;numbers.csv&#39;) However, with a comma-delimited file as input this is likely to cause an error - Python has no way of knowing that elements in your file are separated by a space and will throw an error because something like “1,2,3” cannot be interpreted as a single numeric value. To tell Python that our data is comma-delimited, we can use the optional argument, delimiter: myNumbers = np.loadtxt(&#39;numbers.csv&#39;, delimiter=&#39;,&#39;) Now, each number is encoded as its own element: array([1, 2, 3]) Notice that unlike the file name, we need to specify the name of this optional argument (delimiter=). Because the file name argument is mandatory, numpy always expects the first argument to be the filename. However, since there are many possible optional arguments that once can use, it is impossible to infer which optional argument is being referred to by position alone. For optional arguments, we always need to specify their name. np.loadtxt() has many useful optional arguments - for example skiplines, which allows the user to skip the first n lines of a file. A full list of the optional arguments to np.loadtxt() can be found here 4.12.2 Indexing numpy arrays Within a numpy array, we often want to look at a specific element or set of elements. To do this, we use indexing. First, we can see the total size of an array by looking at the array’s shape attribute. An attribute is a property inherent to a specific data type; it is typically viewed with the following syntax: print(&lt;variableName&gt;.&lt;attributeName&gt;). We can therefore look at the shape of our array as such: print(myNumbers.shape). This returns the number of rows and columns, respectively: (45, 12) - 45 rows and 12 columns. 4.12.2.1 Accessing Single Values To look within these rows and columns for specific values, we use indexing: dataName[&lt;rowNumber&gt;, &lt;columnNumber&gt;] For example, to print the value in the fifth row and third column of myNumbers, we would write: print(myNumbers[4, 2]) Remember that in Python, we start counting at 0. 4.12.2.2 Accessing Multiple Values To print multiple consecutive items, we can provide two numbers separated by a colon :. print(myNumbers[2:4, 5:10]) Note that the first number is inclusive and the second number is exclusive: We will print the elements in rows 3 and 4 and not row 5.
